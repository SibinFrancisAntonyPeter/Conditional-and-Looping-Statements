#3 Write a program to calculate your BMI and give weight status. Body Mass Index (BMI) is an internationally used measurement
 # to check if you are a healthy weight for your height.The metric BMI formula accepts weight in kilograms and height in meters:
 # BMI= weight(kg)/height2(m2) BMI Weight Status Categories table BMI range - kg/m2 Category
 # Below 18.5 Underweight 18.5 -24.9 Normal 25 - 29.9 Overweight 30 & Above Obese

weight = float(input("Enter your weight in (kg): "))
height = float(input("Enter your height in (m): "))

bmi = weight / ( height * height )

if bmi < 18.5:
    category ="Underweight"
elif 18.5 < bmi <24.9:
    category = "Normal"
elif 25 < bmi < 29.9:
    category = "Overweight"
else:
    category = "Obese"

print(" Your bmi is :", round(bmi,2))
print("You are in the ",category," range")
